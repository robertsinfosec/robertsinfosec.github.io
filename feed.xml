This seemed to be affecting my sleep. I was curious how much caffeine I was actually consuming and how long it stayed in my system, so I built a simple app to track it. I wanted to share my experience and the process I went through to build it.

However, for a hobbyist looking for a free solution, the free tier of GitHub Actions is limited to 2000 minutes per month. This is fine for small projects, but if you're doing a lot of builds or deployments, you might hit that limit. A really great solution to this is that you can host your own GitHub Ru... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Setting Up a Public VPS</title><link href="https://www.robertsinfosec.com/posts/setting-up-a-public-vps/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Setting Up a Public VPS" /><published>2025-02-11T02:42:00-05:00</published> <updated>2025-02-11T02:42:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://www.robertsinfosec.com/posts/setting-up-a-public-vps/</id> <content src="https://www.robertsinfosec.com/posts/setting-up-a-public-vps/" /> <author> <name>robertsinfosec</name> </author> <category term="Installation Guides" /> <category term="Operating Systems" /> <summary> There are many reasons you might need to have a public-facing server. You might want to host a website, run a game server, or just have a place to store your files. Whatever the reason, it's important to make sure your server is secure and configured correctly. Since this comes up both for myself, or when I'm helping others, I thought it would be a good idea to document the steps I take to set... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Working Locally with Supabase</title><link href="https://www.robertsinfosec.com/posts/working-locally-with-supabase/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Working Locally with Supabase" /><published>2025-01-31T08:03:00-05:00</published> <updated>2025-02-02T17:57:46-05:00</updated> <id>https://www.robertsinfosec.com/posts/working-locally-with-supabase/</id> <content src="https://www.robertsinfosec.com/posts/working-locally-with-supabase/" /> <author> <name>robertsinfosec</name> </author> <category term="App Development" /> <category term="Backend" /> <summary> I started my journey sort of backwards, where I started with a backend up on supabase.com, and I'm now learning how to use it locally. The point of this post is to document the steps I took to get a local Supabase instance running, and how to do migrations and interact with other instances. What is Supabase? Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative. It's a service that provides a Postg... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>OpenVMS on ProxMox</title><link href="https://www.robertsinfosec.com/posts/openvms-on-proxmox/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="OpenVMS on ProxMox" /><published>2025-01-17T12:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2025-01-17T22:29:52-05:00</updated> <id>https://www.robertsinfosec.com/posts/openvms-on-proxmox/</id> <content src="https://www.robertsinfosec.com/posts/openvms-on-proxmox/" /> <author> <name>robertsinfosec</name> </author> <category term="Homelab Series" /> <category term="Other OSes" /> <summary> This post is for a very specific niche, but also just so I have it documented somewhere. In the world of midrange and mainframe computers, particularly from the Golden Age of computing in the 1970's and 1980's, there is OpenVMS. This operating system was originally developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for their VAX minicomputers. OpenVMS is still in use today, particularly in the fi... </summary> </entry> </feed>
